The Telangana Gig and Platform Workers’ Union (TGPWU) appreciates the Telangana Government for issuing G.O. Ms. No. 41 dated 16.11.2024, exempting Road Tax and Registration Fees for Electric Vehicles (EVs) purchased and registered in Telangana until 31.12.2026. This is a commendable step towards promoting sustainable and eco-friendly transportation in the state.

However, to further support the adoption of electric vehicles by gig and platform workers, we humbly request the government to provide a 50% special subsidy for the purchase of commercial electric vehicles, including:

- Two-wheelers (for delivery workers).
- Three-wheelers (e-rickshaws and goods carriers).
- Four-wheelers (taxis and tourist cabs).

Many gig and platform workers, including delivery agents and cab drivers, rely on their vehicles for daily income. Transitioning to electric vehicles would significantly reduce operational costs and environmental impact. However, the high upfront cost of EVs poses a significant barrier for these workers. A 50% subsidy would make EVs more accessible and contribute to the government’s goals of reducing pollution and promoting green mobility.

We urge the Telangana Government to consider this request and extend further support to gig and platform workers, who are integral to the state’s economy and service ecosystem.
