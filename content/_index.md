The Telangana Gig and Platforms Workers Union (TGPWU) is an independent, worker-led union that was founded in 2021, to advance the interests of gig and platform workers in Telangana, India. We fight for higher pay, fair and dignified working conditions, and benefits for gig and platform workers. 

We have no association with any app-based platform companies.
