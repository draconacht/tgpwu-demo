			<h2 id="our-history">Our History</h2>
<p>The Telangana Gig and Platforms Workers Union (TGPWU) was founded in 2021 to represent the interests of gig workers and platform workers in Telangana, India.</p>
<p>The Union was formed to help workers realise the benefits granted to them in the <a href="https://labour.gov.in/sites/default/files/SS_Code_Gazette.pdf">Code on Social Security (Central) Rules, 2020</a>, released by the Government of India in December 2020. The mission of the Union is to advocate for implementation of schemes outlined in the Code, across areas such as life and disability cover, health and maternity benefits, old age protection, and education (to be offered by the Central Government); and  provident fund, employment injury benefit, housing, educational schemes for children, skill upgradation of workers, funeral assistance, old age homes (to be offered by the State Government).</p>
<p>Set up during the COVID – 19 pandemic, the Union also aims to collectivise workers to help negotiate improved terms of employment with various forms of digital platforms, and support campaigns against unjust or exploitative practices. Apart from working towards implementation of the Code of Social Security, the Union will attempt to expand protections in areas such as dispute resolution, work-place benefits, and data sharing with technology platform companies, with a long term, 10 year horizon for activities and protections.</p>
<p>The Union works towards the benefits of a wide variety of gig and platform workers, ranging from <strong>app-based taxi drivers or motorcycle riders</strong> for mobility platforms (Uber, Ola, Rapido), <strong>delivery agents</strong> for logistics and e-commerce platforms (Dunzo, Delhivery, Shadowfax, Amazon, Flipkart) and food delivery platforms (Zomato, Swiggy), and <strong>‘freelance’ or ‘part-time’ workers</strong> for gig marketplace platforms (Urban Company, Housejoy).</p>
<h2 id="affiliations">Affiliations</h2>
